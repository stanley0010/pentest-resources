# Hardware

### Hardware

#### Inspection

* External inspection
* Internal inspection
  * Datasheet, FCC database
  * components used in the device, CPU architecture type, communication protocols used, mobile application details, firmware upgrade process, input/output/debug ports, external media support on devices, etc

#### Protocols

![](<../../attachments/Pasted image 20220707135441.png>)

* UART
  * Identity pins
  * Connect to Attify Badge (our UART reader device)
  * Identify Baud rate
  * Interact
* I2C, SPI for reading flash/ other storage medium
* JTAG for debugging and dumping contents in flash

#### Approaches

* Informational
  * getting debug info by just connecting
  * dumping data, flash memory and firmware
  * editing data/memory
* System
  * directly connect to debug ports may provide shell
  * Shorting NAND pin to gain u-boot root shell, bypassing system shell
  * replace with malicious firmware
