# Communication

## General Approach

1. identify protocol, frequency/sample rate/modulation, channel and address
2. sniffing and decode
3. (bypass auth)
4. replay-based attack/ modifying packet data

## MQTT

1. authentication optional and in clear text
2. check if there is sensitive information, subscribe/send to all topics, clientID misconfig
3. fuzzing

## CoAP

1. check auth mechanism, DTLS may not be used
2. fuzzing URIs
   1. Enumerate resources by GET, check PUT/POST/DELETE

## Radio

1. identify frequency, modulation, data rate, sample rate
2. decode, replay with different values in the command

## Zigbee and BLE

1. identify channel used among 16 channels
2. intercept, replay, modify packets
3. Tool: KillerBee (not well supported), ZigDiddity, BTLEJuice (framework)

Study packet and observe pattern
